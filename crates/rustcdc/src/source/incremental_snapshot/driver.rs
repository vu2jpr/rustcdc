//! Source-agnostic DBLog incremental snapshot.
//!
//! # Why this is one implementation and not three
//!
//! The watermark algorithm is identical for every log-based source; only the
//! *position type* and the *SQL dialect* differ. It used to be copied once per
//! connector, and the copies drifted: the resume-from-cursor fix (C1 in the audit)
//! had to be applied three times because the same missing feature existed three
//! times. A connector now supplies [`IncrementalSnapshotBackend`] — six methods of
//! genuinely database-specific work — and inherits the state machine, the override
//! window, cursor persistence and the [`StreamHandle`] contract unchanged.
//!
//! This is also the extension point for third-party connectors: an `impl Source`
//! that implements the backend gets non-blocking snapshots without reimplementing
//! the correctness-critical part.
//!
//! # The algorithm
//!
//! For each chunk the driver:
//! 1. Captures a **low watermark** position before the `SELECT`.
//! 2. Captures the set of **transactions still in flight**, which closes the
//!    commit-visibility race described below.
//! 3. Reads `chunk_size` rows using keyset pagination, outside any transaction.
//! 4. Captures a **high watermark** position after the `SELECT`.
//! 5. Keeps polling the live stream, recording the primary key of every event for
//!    the snapshotted table that the `SELECT` could not have seen — either its position
//!    falls in `(low, high]`, or it belongs to one of the in-flight transactions.
//! 6. Once the stream advances past the high watermark, emits snapshot `Read`
//!    events only for chunk rows whose primary key was **not** in that override set.
//!
//! The live stream passes through to the consumer unchanged in every phase, so the
//! consumer sees one continuous, gap-free feed with snapshot rows interleaved. No
//! long-held transaction is ever opened, so the source accumulates no transaction-ID
//! backlog and the stream never pauses.
//!
//! # Why the override window is required
//!
//! A chunk read is not atomic with respect to the stream. A row modified between the
//! two watermarks appears both in the chunk (at its pre-modification value) and in
//! the stream (at its post-modification value). Emitting both in chunk-then-stream
//! order would be harmless; emitting them in the order they are *produced* would
//! resurrect the stale value. Suppressing the chunk copy makes the outcome
//! independent of interleaving.
//!
//! # Why the low watermark alone is not the bracket
//!
//! The obvious bracket — "log position in `(low, high]`" — is unsound on every database
//! this crate supports, because reaching the log and becoming visible are two steps with
//! a gap between them. PostgreSQL writes a transaction's commit record to WAL (advancing
//! `pg_current_wal_lsn()`), flushes it, and only then clears the transaction from the proc
//! array; a chunk `SELECT` starting inside that gap still reads the *old* row while the
//! transaction's log position already sits below the low watermark. The position test
//! misses it, the chunk row is not suppressed, and the pre-image overwrites the newer
//! stream value — the very corruption the override window exists to prevent, reachable
//! whenever a commit's fsync overlaps a chunk read.
//!
//! So membership in the window is a question about **visibility**, not about ordering, and only
//! the backend can answer it — the evidence differs per engine and none of it is a log position.
//! [`IncrementalSnapshotBackend::event_in_bracket`] is that question. Its default is the ordinal
//! test, which is correct only where the watermark lags visibility rather than leading it
//! (SQL Server, whose capture job harvests after commit); the backends that need more override it:
//!
//! * **PostgreSQL** captures `pg_current_snapshot()` alongside the LSN and asks whether the
//!   event's `xid` was invisible to the low watermark's snapshot — `xid >= xmax || xip.contains`.
//! * **MySQL** captures `Executed_Gtid_Set`, which the server updates *after* the engine commit,
//!   and takes the set difference between the two bounds.
//!
//! # Why events past the high watermark are held back
//!
//! The override window closes at the high watermark, so an event *past* it is not
//! suppressed — correctly, because such an event committed after the `SELECT`
//! finished and therefore describes a row state the chunk cannot contain. What the
//! algorithm additionally requires is that the chunk is emitted **at** the high
//! watermark, before any later log event. DBLog gets this for free by emitting the
//! buffered chunk the moment the high-watermark marker is read from the log.
//!
//! Here the log is read in batches, and one batch routinely straddles the high
//! watermark: it can carry events at LSN 900 (inside the window) and 1200 (past it)
//! together. Returning the whole batch and *then* the chunk hands the consumer the
//! newer value first and the chunk's older value second — the exact stale-value
//! resurrection the override window exists to prevent, just moved one step later.
//!
//! So a straddling batch is split at the first event past the high watermark: the
//! head is delivered, the chunk follows, and the tail is delivered after it. Order
//! within the log is preserved, and the chunk lands exactly where DBLog puts it.

    /// races concurrent writes and yields a value from an unknown point in time. That
    /// objection does not apply here, and the difference is the whole reason this is safe:
    ///
    /// - The value does not come from an out-of-band read. It comes from **this chunk's**
    ///   `SELECT`, at a snapshot the driver knows the position of.
    /// - `unavailable_columns` means the `UPDATE` **did not modify** those columns. So their
    ///   post-event value equals their value at the start of the event.
    /// - The only thing that could have changed a column between the chunk snapshot and this
    ///   event is another transaction — and any such transaction is *also* inside the bracket
    ///   (it commits after the chunk snapshot), so its event has already passed through here
    ///   and folded its values into the shadow image. If it modified the column, it carried
    ///   it; if it did not, the chunk value still stands.
