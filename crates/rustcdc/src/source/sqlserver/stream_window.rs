    /// - **consumed** (`start <= end`): everything through `end` was read, so the next lower bound is
    ///   `increment(end)`;
    /// - **empty** (`start > end`): nothing was read, so the lower bound **stays** and only the upper

    ///
    /// An empty window whose maximum later jumps therefore reopens as `[start, new_max]` — with the
    /// original `start` intact, so nothing between it and the new maximum is skipped.
