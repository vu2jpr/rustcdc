//! SQL Server source configuration and connection lifecycle.
//!
//! # TLS: this connector uses a different stack than the rest of the crate
//!
//! Every other connector and sink in rustcdc negotiates TLS with `rustls 0.23`.
//! `tiberius 0.12.3` hard-pins `tokio-rustls 0.24`, so enabling the `sqlserver` feature
//! links a **second, older** copy — `rustls 0.21` / `rustls-webpki 0.101.7` — and that is
//! the stack this connector actually speaks TLS with. It carries RUSTSEC-2026-0098,
//! -0099 and -0104, plus the unmaintained `rustls-pemfile 1.0` via
//! `rustls-native-certs 0.6`.
//!
//! It is not deduplicable and not fixable from rustcdc: the advisories are resolved only
//! in `rustls-webpki >= 0.103.12`, which needs `rustls 0.23`, which is not
//! semver-reachable from tiberius' pin. Two of the three are unreachable on rustcdc's code
//! paths (no CRL is ever parsed; no URI name is ever asserted) and the third additionally
//! requires a trusted CA to have misissued a certificate.
//!
//! The per-advisory reachability analysis, the mitigations, and the `cargo deny`
//! suppressions live in `site/content/docs/security.md` and `deny.toml`. Deployments that
//! cannot accept the exposure should leave the feature disabled — it is not a default.
