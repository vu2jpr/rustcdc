//! Sensitive data masking and hashing transform.
//!
//! # Security Note
//!
//! [`MaskRule::UnsaltedSha256`] provides **obfuscation**, not pseudonymization.
//! SHA-256 is a deterministic, fast hash: for low-cardinality fields (e.g. gender, country code)
//! or enumerable values, the original value can be recovered via brute-force lookup.
//! For GDPR-grade pseudonymization use `MaskRule::HmacSha256` or `MaskRule::Encrypt`
//! instead — both require the `encryption` feature, which is why they are named here
//! rather than linked.
