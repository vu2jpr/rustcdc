/// # Why every pattern-matching transform reports this
///
/// Masking, filtering and routing all match by **pattern against a permissive default**,
/// so a typo, an upstream column rename, or an earlier stage that moved a field disables
/// a rule *silently*. Nothing errors; the pipeline keeps running and produces plausible
/// output. What it does instead is the specific harm each transform exists to prevent:
///
/// | Transform | A rule that never fires means |
/// |---|---|
/// | [`MaskHashTransform`] | a column is shipping in **clear text** |
/// | [`FilterProjectionTransform`] | rows meant to be excluded are being delivered |
/// | [`RouteTransform`] | events are going to the **default destination**, not the one configured |
///
/// Failing closed is not the answer — it would refuse to start over a rule for an
/// optional column, and operators would respond by deleting rules. So each rule carries a
/// hit counter, the runtime exposes the never-fired ones as
/// `rustcdc_transform_rules_unmatched`, and the condition becomes an alert rule rather
/// than a log line someone has to grep for at shutdown.
///
/// Zero hits is only meaningful **after real traffic**. Evaluate against a representative
/// sample, not at startup.
